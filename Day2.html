<h4>What I Want To Say</h4>
<p>I wasn't able to listen properly during your discussion on the part of the header and footer until the last part due to the noise here and mother is calling me to go outside. I wasn't able to catch up with your discussion. I was tring to get your attention and tell you to stop whenever I can hear you due to noise, but you are so unstoppable. Maybe you also can't hear me by that time. I am trying to stop you because I don't want your effort to be wasted because I can't listen to what you are discussing there. I just took a screenshot and try to follow it, so I am able to insert the image here. But I am not really sure if I did it right. HAHAHA. Again, thank you for the privilege of learning all of this from you. I hope I am not consuming majority of your time an energy. HAHAH. Until next time! </p>
